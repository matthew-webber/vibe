# vibe Snake Game

This repository contains a simple snake game implemented in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Open `index.html` in a browser to play. The game uses the entire browser window except for a small score display at the top. On mobile devices tap the left or right side of the screen to turn the snake left or right. On desktop you can use the arrow keys or the **WASD** keys.

The game starts automatically when the page loads.
